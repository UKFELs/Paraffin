# Paraffin
A collection of pre and post processing tools for Puffin.

Includes packages for matching the beam to a periodic lattice, scaling particle data from SU to Puffin notation (and vice-versa), and up-sampling the sparse beam from accelerator codes to a finer distribution more suitable for a FEL simulation.
